<h2>About Cat Fanciers&copy;</h2>
<h3>This group was founded on the premise that cats are what own us. We all can agree here that we cannot plan our days without a swift swat of the cat paw to dictate our moves.

Events are held semi-annually in a location that is generally TBD.

A support section is up-and-coming, for those of you facing cat issues.

Chances are that there is a Cat Fancier&copy; member in your area. Admin can help provide contact info for a small fee.

Meow.</h3>
